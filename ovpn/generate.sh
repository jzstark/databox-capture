OpenVPN
-------
For security reasons, OpenVPN clients typically have their own unique certificate and private key. The server you will be connecting to has been configured to allow clients to share the same certificate and private key, but you may still wish to give your phone and laptop different keys, for example.

1. Click *Next* on the *Installation Complete* screen.

### Linux ###
1. Install OpenVPN:

\`sudo apt-get install openvpn\` OR \`sudo yum install openvpn\` OR \`esoteric-package-manager hipster openvpn\` OR [other platform](https://openvpn.net/index.php/access-server/download-openvpn-as-sw.html).

   * If installing OpenVPN via your package manager is not an option, you can also download and compile the [OpenVPN source code](https://openvpn.net/index.php/download/58-open-source/downloads.html).
1. Download [OpenVPN profile](/ovpn/databox.ovpn)
1. Copy the downloaded \`$CLIENT_NAME\` file to the location of your choice. */etc/openvpn/* is a decent option.
1. On some distributions, the pushed DHCP DNS option from the OpenVPN server will be ignored. This means that your DNS queries will still be routed through your ISP's servers which makes them vulnerable to what is known as a DNS leak.
   * You can test whether or not your DNS is leaking [here](https://dnsleaktest.com/).
   * You can ensure that the correct DNS servers are used by adding the following lines to the top of the \`$CLIENT_NAME\` file:
     * \`script-security 2\`
     * \`up /etc/openvpn/update-resolv-conf\`
     * \`down /etc/openvpn/update-resolv-conf\`
1. Change direction to the profile location, execute OpenVPN, and pass it the .ovpn profile as an option: 
    \`sudo openvpn $CLIENT_NAME\`

1. Success! You can verify that your traffic is being routed properly by [looking up your IP address on Google](https://encrypted.google.com/search?hl=en&q=ip%20address). It should say *Your public IP address is $IP*.
