Capture data generated by Proxy (logs) and VPN (tcpdump)

**Basic Workflow**:

- Proxy: Start Squid container, and start `capture/logSquid.py` to store squid log file into Mongodb containers. 
- VPN: Start VPN container, and start `capture/runtcpdump.sh` to get traffic data into pcap files, and then run `capture/logVPN.py` to access .pcap files and store information into MongoDB containter.
